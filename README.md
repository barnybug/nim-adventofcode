# Advent of code

My solutions in nim for the adventofcode.com puzzles, December 2015.

## Day 1: Not Quite Lisp
Simple ticker tape problem.

## Day 2: I Was Told There Would Be No Math
Regex parse "axbxc", sort, and perform some simple calculations.

## Day 3: Perfectly Spherical Houses in a Vacuum
2D ticker tape example, with recording of locations visited in a 2D array.

## Day 4: The Ideal Stocking Stuffer
MD5 loop on a concatenated string.

## Day 5: Doesn't He Have Intern-Elves For This?
Some regex rules for character repetitions applied to filter the input.

## Day 6: Probably a Fire Hazard
Eloborate 'ticker tape' - 2D array board modified by box commands in input.

## Day 7: Some Assembly Required
Delayed evaluation of boolean syntax for wire network. With cache hash table for performance.

## Day 8: Matchsticks
Simple regex find/replace on input strings.

## Day 9: All in a Single Night
Travelling salesman problem - simple bruteforce approach based on a table of costs for traversing between two nodes using permutations of nodes.

## Day 10: Elves Look, Elves Say
Brute force byte array processing (for efficiency particularly).

## Day 11: Corporate Policy
Similar to day 5 with regex rules and incrementing a string character by character.

## Day 12: JSAbacusFramework.io
JSON parse/recursive traversal.

## Day 13: Knights of the Dinner Table
Rehash of day 9 - brute-force permutations search of costs.

## Day 14: Reindeer Olympics
Fairly simple iterative application of rules with state tracked by 'Reindeer' objects.

## Day 15: Science for Hungry People
Brute-force combinations with replacement of 4 dimension space, and cost scoring.

## Day 16: Aunt Sue
Regex parsing input into set of features, and then filtering of features by the criteria down to answer.

## Day 17: No Such Thing as Too Much
Brute force combinations of inputs to sum to a given value.

## Day 18: Like a GIF For Your Yard
Conway's game of life.

## Day 19: Medicine for Rudolph
Rule application to calculate minimum substitutions for a -> b.

## Day 20: Infinite Elves and Infinite Houses
Variation on Erastothenes sieve to find minimum sum of factors > X.

## Day 21: RPG Simulator 20XX
Addition of permutations to minimise cost.

## Day 22: Wizard Simulator 20XX
Minimal breadth first search of possible 'moves'.

## Day 23: Opening the Turing Lock
Interpreting an instruction based program.

## Day 24: It Hangs in the Balance
Bin packing problem evaluating combinations.

## Day 25: Let It Snow
Triangular numbers, modular exponentiation.
